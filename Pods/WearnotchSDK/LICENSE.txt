2. “Powered by Notch” Distribution Program

         2.1. Application to “Powered by Notch” Distribution Program.  In order to distribute your Application or your Device, you must submit your Application or Device to Notch for licensing consideration through its “Powered by Notch” program. Applications or devices that are accepted into the “Powered by Notch” program will become “Powered by Notch” Software and “Powered by Notch” Devices. You must first decide that your Application or Device has been adequately tested and is complete. By submitting your Application or Device, you represent and warrant that your Application or Device complies with the program requirements and application and device specifications provided to you by Notch and updated from time to time. You further agree that you will not attempt to hide, misrepresent or obscure any features, content, services or functionality in your submitted Applications or Device from Notch’s review or otherwise hinder Notch from being able to fully review such Applications and Devices. You agree to provide access to or samples of any such applications or devices at your expense (samples will not be returned). You agree to cooperate with Notch in this submission process and to answer questions and provide information and materials reasonably requested by Notch regarding your submitted Application or Device, including information Notch may request relating to your Application or Device, the operation of your business, or your obligations under this Agreement. Notch may require you to carry certain levels of insurance for certain types of Applications or Devices and name Notch as an additional insured. If you make any changes to an Application or Device after submission to Notch, you must resubmit the Application or Device to Notch. Similarly all bug fixes, updates, upgrades, modifications, enhancements, supplements to, revisions, new releases, redesigns, and new versions of your Application or Device must be submitted to Notch for review in order for them to be considered for a distribution license, except as otherwise permitted by Notch.

2.2. Selection by Notch for a Distribution License. You understand and agree that if you submit your Application or Device to Notch to the “Powered by Notch” program for a distribution license, Notch may, in its sole discretion:

You will be solely responsible for developing Applications and Devices that are safe, free of defects in design and operation, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. You will also be solely responsible for any documentation, end-user customer support and warranties for such Applications and Devices. The fact that Notch may have reviewed, tested, approved or selected an Application or Device will not relieve you of any of these responsibilities.

            2.3. Applications and Devices .  Applications or Devices accepted into the “Powered by Notch” distribution license program may be distributed: through the Notch Store, if selected by Notch, (2) through any other distribution channel if selected and approved by Notch.
